Some notes on this software.

note (1): Both quadrature encoder ISRs contain additional code to correct a quadrature sensor pulse problem on my sample motor.
If the sensor had worked correctly, the following code would not be required in each of the ISRs:

    _directionA_CCW = _lastSensorA == HIGH && _lastSensorB == LOW || _lastSensorA == LOW && _lastSensorB == HIGH;
    if (!(_directionA_CCW ^ _directionB_CCW))
    {
      _directionCCW = _directionA_CCW;
    }

Instead, we would only need:

	_directionCCW = _lastSensorA == HIGH && _lastSensorB == LOW || _lastSensorA == LOW && _lastSensorB == HIGH;
