Some notes on this software.

note (1): Both quadrature encoder ISRs contain additional code to correct a quadrature sensor pulse problem on my sample motor.
If the sensor had worked correctly, the following code would not be required in each of the ISRs:

    _directionA_CCW = _lastSensorA == HIGH && _lastSensorB == LOW || _lastSensorA == LOW && _lastSensorB == HIGH;
    if (!(_directionA_CCW ^ _directionB_CCW))
    {
      _directionCCW = _directionA_CCW;
    }

Instead, we would only need:

	_directionCCW = _lastSensorA == HIGH && _lastSensorB == LOW || _lastSensorA == LOW && _lastSensorB == HIGH;


note (2): Torque estimates are made by measuring the commanded current of the motor and using the values of the torque constant from the data-sheet of the motor together with the model of the transmission. These transmission models assume 100% efficiency, and accuracy of torque estimates and commands are limited by the friction in the drivetrain, so joint torque accuracy should be characterized where one is relying on it.
